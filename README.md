# _Book_Store_

<!--

  header.php is the shared background for login and enroll forms, it's content is index.php's background


-->

<!--

  Every time you create a new page, make sure to update index.php where routing is handled,
  
  How you do that is adding the new page's name and location to the routing table(array)

  and When you header to a location outside of index.php use /_Book_Store_/name syntax, name is the name of the file

  AND when you require/include another file inside any file thats not index.php, include the full path(relative sometimes causes problems)
